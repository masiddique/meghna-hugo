Spillage of oil from freight vessels and oil tankers in open sea waters is a persisting problem. Every year thousands of oil spills occur in oceans across the globe. At times it is caused by accidents involving tankers, barges, pipelines, refineries, drilling rigs, and storage facilities; at other times, natural disasters such as hurricanes damaging the facilities, or deliberate acts of vandalism and illegal bilge dumping become the cause of spillage. Typically, the spilled oil keeps floating on the water surface, and spreads out rapidly due to the waves and currents. It is toxic to marine life, both plants and animals, and is therefore a matter of serious concern.
