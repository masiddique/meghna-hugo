##### Are you confused where should you open your new outlet? What is your growth potential given competitors in the same locality? Créneau answers your questions on the basis of AI-driven spatial analytics.

We have served clients in various aspects related to Location Intelligence & Geomarketing. To exemplify, say you run a fuel station, and now you intend to expand your business and open new filling points. The effort to pick a good location is enormous, with so many concerns to take care of! The high costs of the real estate and licensing fee can gobble up your budget, and if the returns are low, it may dent you business beyond repair.

Or machine learning driven spatial modeling incorporates several parameters (such as the population density, underlaying urban sprawl, infrastructure, requisite traffic flows, competitor outreach & penetration, etc.) to provide you `customized recommendations` given your budgetary constraints.
